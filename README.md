# ðŸš€ Introduction

Welcome to `numpy-journey` â€” a personal, practical repository documenting my learning process and deep dive into **NumPy**, one of the core libraries for numerical computing in Python.
This repository captures my entire journeyâ€”from the very first array I created to implementing advanced operations like **broadcasting**, **vectorized computations**, and **statistical functions**. Every notebook and script here reflects what Iâ€™ve practiced and learned through hands-on exploration.

Throughout this journey, I used **Jupyter Notebook** to experiment with and visualize concepts, often incorporating _LaTeX_ to clearly express mathematical ideas. I also followed good development practices using tools like **Ruff** for code quality and **uv** as a lightweight, modern Python package manager to manage dependencies efficiently aiming to keep everything clean, fast, and reproducible.

This repository serves as both a **learning log** and a **reference**. Iâ€™ve organized it in a way that others can follow along or revisit key topics when needed.


## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tams3d/numpy-journey.git
cd numpy-journey
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # For Windows
# or
source .venv/bin/activate      # For macOS/Linux
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
uv sync
```
This will install all required packages listed in the pyproject.toml file, including numpy, matplotlib, and ruff and dev dependencies.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

The repository covers a wide range of NumPy topics, including but not limited to:

- Array creation and initialization  
- Array operations and properties  
- Broadcasting and vectorization  
- Indexing, slicing, and iterating arrays  
- Sorting and filtering elements
- Stacking, splitting, and reshaping arrays  
- Mathematical functions and statistical operations  
- Set operations and custom user-defined functions
- General utility functions and tricks

## ðŸ™‹ About Me

I'm an 18-year-old with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. I learn best through hands-on projects and real-world experimentation.
Beyond programming, I enjoy creative work like photo/video editing and 3D design in Blender, building tools to enhance these workflows by combining technical and creative thinking.

Currently, I'm focused on deep learning and generative AI, with a goal of contributing to research and open-source work. 
This repository reflects my commitment to mastering core tools like NumPy as part of my foundation in scientific and AI computing.
